Panel for Jupyter
Starting to experiment with Panel for Jupyter.
Installing it into my Jupyter lab environment
 
This will also work with jupyter notebook but requires an extension.  See https://panel.holoviz.org/getting_started/#jupyterlab-and-classic-notebook
 
I started tinkering in SSOS/Code/PanelTests, so far it's not working
 
PandasGUI library
Looked useful but pip install didn't work.  Could try again.
Downloaded a titanic.csv file to local Github datasets   repo to try it out.
